# [Camera-Controller-Shaker-Maker-For-Maya](https://www.highend3d.com/maya/script/camera-controller-shaker-maker-for-maya "摄像机抖动模拟插件")

  This is a small GUI that allows you to control your cameras, as well as add, remove and control a procedural Camera shake. Perfect for previs/layout and for camera animation.  With it you can easily change focal lengths and rotate a camera in place (pan, not orbit) without having the camera selected.  You may also control the translation of the camera as well.
